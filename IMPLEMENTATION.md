# Day 1 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

1. **PNPM Workspace Setup**
   - Configured `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to include all projects
   - Created a root `package.json` with shared dev dependencies
   - Added workspace-aware scripts for easier project management

2. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Set up ESLint with TypeScript support
   - Added Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Created `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings
   - Implemented Husky for Git hooks integration
   - Added lint-staged for pre-commit code quality checks
   - Set up commitlint for conventional commit messages

3. **Shared Type Definitions**
   - Created `packages/contracts` package for shared types
   - Defined comprehensive type definitions for:
     - Restaurant entities
     - Product entities
     - Client entities
     - Authentication tokens
     - Order entities
   - Added proper TypeScript configurations

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `packages/env` package for environment validation
   - Implemented Zod schemas for various environment configurations
   - Set up dotenv-safe integration for validation against example files
   - Created example environment files for all projects

5. **Project Structure Improvements**
   - Added consistent script definitions across all packages
   - Created a script to update package.json files for consistency
   - Updated README.md with new setup instructions

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Backend Hardening**
   - Implement the security middleware (helmet, rate-limiting, etc.)
   - Integrate with the shared contracts package
   - Add proper validation using Zod schemas

2. **Application Integration**
   - Update each application to use the shared types
   - Implement consistent API response handling
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Testing & CI/CD**
   - Set up testing framework for each application
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Add code coverage reporting

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Build Shared Packages**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build:contracts
   pnpm run build:env
   ```

3. **Run Individual Applications**
   ```bash
   # Backend API
   pnpm run dev:backend
   
   # Customer App
   pnpm run dev:frontend
   
   # Admin Dashboard
   pnpm run dev:admin
   
   # Restaurant Dashboard
   pnpm run dev:restaurant
   ```

All tasks for Day 1 have been successfully completed, establishing a solid foundation for the EatOnTime project with shared types and enforced style baselines.
